# odin-react-cv-builder
## The Odin Project - CV Application

Project completed as part of The Odin Project. My first React application. Create an application that allows a user to build a CV/resume.

## Features:
 - Users can add and edit personal, education, and experience information
 - Users can add multiple experiences

## Languages/Technologies used:
 - Javascript/HTML/CSS
 - React
 - Vite
 - ESLint
 - UUID library to generate unique keys
 - date-fns to format dates
 - Netlify to deploy

## What I learned:
 - React Components - how to organize app using components for each section
 - Better understanding of using state and setState, not mutating state
 - Lifting state up and passing it down to components via props
 - Using props - passing variables and functions through components as props
 - Using unique keys to keep array items in order (used UUID to generate random keys)
 - How to use onChange to handle changes with multiple input fields in a form
 - Conditionally rendering UI using ternary operator for editing forms
 
## Still can improve:
 - Kept styling very simple to mimic a real resume, but could add additional styling (like ability to add multiple bullet point items to experience sections)
 - Could add a way for the user to save the resume as a pdf
